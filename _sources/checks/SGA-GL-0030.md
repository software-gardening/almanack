## Why it matters

Ensuring that notebook cells are executed in order improves readability and maintains reproducibility. Out-of-order execution can cause unexpected results, make it difficult to follow the workflow, and lead to errors when running or sharing the notebook with others.

## How it works

Open your notebook and use the &#34;Run All&#34; or &#34;Restart &amp; Run All&#34; option in your notebook interface (such as Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab) to execute all cells sequentially from top to bottom. This ensures that all variables and outputs are generated in the correct order, making the notebook reproducible and easier to understand for others.
