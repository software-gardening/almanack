# Understanding

Understanding is the bedrock of any successful project.
It encompasses not only the technical aspects but also the collaborative and ethical dimensions that ensure a project's growth and sustainability.
Just as a gardener must understand the needs of each plant to cultivate a thriving garden, contributors to a project must grasp its goals, structure, and community standards to foster a productive and harmonious environment.

## Common files for shared understanding

In the realm of software development, certain files are commonly expected within a repository to ensure clarity, collaboration, and legal compliance.
These files serve as the foundational elements that guide contributors and users, much like a well-tended garden benefits from clear pathways and signs.
They also are correlated with increased rates of project success when present {cite:p}`coelho_why_2017`.
Historically the following files were written in plain-text without formatting.
More recently [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) has become the preferred method of writing these files to help format the documents with styles and media.
GitHub, GitLab, and other software source control hosting platforms often automatically render markdown materials in HTML.

### README

The `README` file is the cornerstone of any repository, providing essential information about the project.
Its presence signifies a well-documented and accessible project, inviting contributors and users alike to understand and engage with the work.
A repository thrives when its purpose and usage are communicated through a `README` file, much like a garden benefits from a clear plan and understanding of its layout.

> "A good rule of thumb is to assume that the information contained within the README will be the only documentation your users read.
> For this reason, your README should include how to install and configure your software, where to find its full documentation, under what license itâ€™s released, how to test it to ensure functionality, and acknowledgments.
> Furthermore, you should include your quickstart guide (as introduced in Rule 3) in your README." {cite:p}`lee_ten_2018`

### CONTRIBUTING

A `CONTRIBUTING` file outlines the guidelines for contributing to the project.
Its presence fosters a welcoming environment for new contributors, ensuring that they have the necessary information to participate effectively.
In the same way that a garden flourishes when there's good understanding of roles and how to care for one another, a project grows stronger when contributors are guided by clear and inclusive instructions.

All development procedures which are specific to the project should be outlined within the `CONTRIBUTING` file (for example, testing and linting expectations, release cadence, etc.).
Consider writing this documentation for each project from the standpoint of an outsider or beginner who may be trying to add a new task, understand the project, or complete an existing task {cite:p}`treude_towards_2024`.

### CODE_OF_CONDUCT

The `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` file sets the standards for behavior within the project community.
Its presence is a commitment to maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment for all participants.
A project community benefits from a shared understanding of respectful and supportive interactions, ensuring that all members can contribute positively, much like a garden requires a harmonious ecosystem to thrive.

### LICENSE

A `LICENSE` file specifies the terms under which the project's code can be used, modified, and shared.
Its presence is crucial for legal clarity and encourages the responsible use and distribution of the project.
Similar to how a garden's health depends on understanding the rules of nature and respecting boundaries, a project's sustainability relies on clear licensing that protects both the creators and users, fostering a culture of trust and collaboration.

## Project documentation

Beyond the common documentation files like `README`'s, `CONTRIBUTING` guides, and `LICENSE` files, comprehensive project documentation is akin to a detailed gardener's almanac for a well-maintained project.
This includes in-depth explanations of the project's architecture, practical usage examples, API references, and development workflows.
Such documentation goes above and beyond to ensure that both novice and seasoned contributors can grasp the project's complexities and contribute effectively.
Just as a thriving garden benefits from meticulous care instructions and shared horticultural knowledge, a project flourishes when its documentation offers a clear and thorough guide to its inner workings, nurturing a collaborative and informed community.

Project documentation often exists within a dedicated `docs` directory where the materials may be created and versioned distinctly from other code.
